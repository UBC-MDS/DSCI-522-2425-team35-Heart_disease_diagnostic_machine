Improvements:
1. Improved summary section of report to include key findings (c3326a2)
2. Made changes to summary in README to include high-level interpretation of analysis findings (368c10b)
3. changed train test split from 90/10 to 80/20. this changes number of test data examples from 22 to 58. score performance increased and discussed in report (dbe6522)
4. 

To do:
3. It would be an added bonus if you could include a comment on how to run the script, which would be a little more convenient to understand intended usage, instead of having to refer to the README.md frequently. It could be as simple as: # Usage: (example). [add comment in docstring on how to run script - copy over from README]
4.  formatting things could be improved, such as capitalization of level 3 headers
