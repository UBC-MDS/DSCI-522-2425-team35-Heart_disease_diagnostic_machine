## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone. We are committed to fostering an inclusive environment, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We strive to act in ways that encourage openness, diversity, inclusivity, and a positive community spirit.

## Our Standards

- Showing empathy and kindness to others
- Respecting differing opinions, perspectives, and experiences
- Offering and accepting constructive feedback gracefully

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project leaders are responsible for defining and upholding the standards of acceptable behavior. They may take appropriate actions to address any unacceptable conduct, including removal or modification of comments, commits, or other contributions. They will communicate reasons for such actions where applicable.

## Scope
