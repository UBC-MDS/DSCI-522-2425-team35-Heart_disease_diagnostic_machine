Improvements:
1. Undid the deletion of target classes 2 & 3 and relabeled those as > 50%. This improved model performance dramatically. Adjusted the report accordingly.
2. Fixed consistency of number reporting (e.g. percentages vs ratio)
3. Fixed misleading results section - we previously said there was a large discrepancy between train and test results but that was resolved. Needed to update the report accordingly.
4. Correcting several typos in report.
5. Added citation for the first statement in the introduction (that heart disease is the leading cause of death)
6. Added print statements to scripts 1 & 2 so users can troubleshoot more easily if needed.
7. Added "Usage" statement in scripts 1 & 2 so it can be standalone outside of Makefile.
